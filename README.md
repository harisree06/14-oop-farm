This assignment exists to allow you to put together all of the knowledge about object oriented programming you have learned so far.

## Prerequisites

- practiced OOP concepts
- collections/iteration
- getting input from the user

## The assignment

You are a farmer that wishes to keep track of the fields on your farm. You want to be able to add fields of various types - for example, corn and wheat - and to keep track of the harvest. You will be keeping track of the total amount of food your farm has ever produced.

Each field type produces a different amount of food per hectare:

- corn: 20
- wheat: 30

You can add fields of choice to your farm by specifying their type (eg. "corn") and their total area in hectares (eg. 100).

When you harvest, you must collect food from every one of your fields and record how much total food you have collected. It should display all of this information.

Sometimes a farmer wants to relax. In doing so, you will get a chance to enjoy the beauty of each one of your fields (without harvesting them).

You can also check the status of each field, which is a more direct way of observing the status of your fields (their size and type). It should also tell you how much total food you have produced up until this point.

The program should provide a list of input options whenever it asks you to enter one.
